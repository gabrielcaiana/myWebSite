# Heey, I`m Gabriel Caiana!

I'm a 25-year-old software developer working primarily with JavaScript | TypeScript | Vue and Nuxt. Passionate about technology, innovation and UX | User interface design.

This is my website which I built in NuxtJS. I use it as my playground for trying out new stuff and having fun. Feel free to have a look around and copy whatever you like as the code is open source so if it helps you then great.
